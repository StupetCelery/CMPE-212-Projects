An Abelian Sandpile is a mathematical model that uses a 2D grid. "Grains of sand" are added to cells in the grid until a cell reaches 4 "grains of sand." At that point, that cell "topples" and is emptied of its sand, and each cell adjacent to it adds 1 grain of sand. Then, if any adjacent cell now contains 4 "grains of sand," they will now topple and the process continues.

Abelian Sandpile models are used to model complex systems in nature, like earthquakes or traffic flow, which can follow a similar cascading pattern.

This code implements an Abelian Sandpile in Java.
